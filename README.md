# 🧩 ScratchFormer

**ScratchFormer** is a Transformer neural network built **entirely from scratch** using **NumPy**.  
This project helps you deeply understand how modern architectures like GPT and BERT actually work — by implementing every part manually, from attention to embeddings.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Pure **NumPy** implementation (no deep learning frameworks)
- 🧠 Full **Encoder–Decoder Transformer** architecture
- 🔍 Implements:
  - Scaled Dot-Product & Multi-Head Attention  
  - Positional Encoding (sinusoidal)  
  - Feed Forward Networks (GELU activation)  
  - Layer Normalization & Residual Connections
- 🧩 Modular and easy to extend
- 💡 Educational, readable, and well-documented
- 🧪 Includes toy training example (copy / translation task)
